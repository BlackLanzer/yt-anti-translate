# YouTube Anti Translate
Source code of [YouTube Anti Translate](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/yt-anti-translate/ndpmhjnlfkgfalaieeneneenijondgag).

I was annoyed by YouTube changing video titles to poorly user-translated versions, so I made this chrome extension to retrive original titles and change them back.

It is much easier to use than it's analogs (as [YoutubeAutotranslateCanceler](https://github.com/pcouy/YoutubeAutotranslateCanceler), because it does not require any YouTube API keys or addition userscript extensions).

## How to use
Just install it from chrome extensions store (https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/yt-anti-translate/ndpmhjnlfkgfalaieeneneenijondgag).

## Etc
