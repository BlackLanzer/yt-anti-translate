# YouTube Anti Translate

Source code of [YouTube Anti Translate](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/yt-anti-translate/ndpmhjnlfkgfalaieeneneenijondgag).

I was annoyed by YouTube changing video titles to poorly user-translated versions, so I made this chrome extension to retrieve original titles and change them back.

It is much easier to use than its analogs (such as [YoutubeAutotranslateCanceler](https://github.com/pcouy/YoutubeAutotranslateCanceler)), because it does not require any YouTube API keys or additional userscript extensions.

## Features

- Restores original video titles on YouTube (Title Anti-Translation)
- Disables automatic audio translation (can be toggled in settings)
- Works automatically without any configuration

## How to use

Just install it from the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/yt-anti-translate/ndpmhjnlfkgfalaieeneneenijondgag).

There's also a [Firefox version](https://addons.mozilla.org/en/firefox/addon/youtube-anti-translate/) (maintained by another developer).
